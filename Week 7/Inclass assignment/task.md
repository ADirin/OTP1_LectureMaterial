# 1. Trip Cost Calculator
[Demo]([SEP1_Week7_Inclass_Solution](https://github.com/ADirin/DATABASE_Solution_Lecture/blob/main/SEP1_Week7_Inclass_Solution))

This is a simple **Java console application** that asks the user for the number of kilometers to travel and the fuel price per liter. It then calculates the total cost of the trip, assuming a fixed fuel consumption rate.

## How It Works
1. The program asks the user for the **distance to travel** (in kilometers).
2. It then asks for the **fuel price per liter**.
3. It assumes a fixed fuel consumption rate of **5 liters per 100 km**.
4. It calculates the **total fuel needed** and then the **total cost**.
5. Finally, it displays the **total cost of the trip**.

### 2. Write Unit Tests and Coverage Tests  
- Use **JUnit 5** to create unit tests for key functionalities.  
- Apply **JaCoCo** (Java Code Coverage Tool) to measure test coverage.  

### 3. Set Up GitHub and Push the Code  
- Initialize a **Git** repository and push the project to **GitHub**.  


### 4. Implement Jenkins Pipeline with Jenkinsfile  
- Create a `Jenkinsfile` to define an automated build and test pipeline.  
- Push the `Jenkinsfile` to the **GitHub** repository.  
- Configure **Jenkins** to run tests using the `Jenkinsfile` from **SCM**.  

### 5. Containerize the Application with Docker  
- Write a `Dockerfile` to define the Java application environment.  
- Build and run the **Docker** image locally.

### 6. Add another stage to your `Jenkinsfile` to deploy the image to hub.docker.com

## 7. Submision
