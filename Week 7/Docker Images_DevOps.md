# Docker Image Demonstration in DevOps

This document outlines how to demonstrate a Docker image in the context of DevOps, emphasizing containerization, automation, continuous integration (CI), continuous deployment (CD), infrastructure as code (IaC), and security.

## 1. Containerization with Docker

- **Overview**: Explain the purpose of your Docker image and the benefits of containerization (portability, isolation, scalability).
- **Docker Hub**: Demonstrate pulling the image:

    ```bash
    docker pull <your_image_name>
    ```

  - Run the container locally:

    ```bash
    docker run -d -p 8080:80 <your_image_name>
    ```

## 2. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Docker Compose or Kubernetes

- **Docker Compose**:
  - Create a `docker-compose.yml` to define multi-container applications.
  - Run:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up
    ```

- **Kubernetes**:
  - Deploy the Docker image using Kubernetes manifests:

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f <manifest>.yaml
    ```

## 3. CI/CD Pipeline with Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, or Azure DevOps

- **Continuous Integration (CI)**:
  - Automate the build process using a CI tool. Every code push triggers:
    - Docker image build.
    - Running tests inside the container.
  
- **Continuous Deployment (CD)**:
  - Automatically deploy the Docker image after successful builds using tools like Jenkins or GitHub Actions.

Example pipeline for GitHub Actions:

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Build Docker image
        run: docker build -t <your_image_name> .
      - name: Push to Docker Hub
        run: |
          echo ${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }} | docker login -u ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }} --password-stdin
          docker push <your_image_name>
````
## 4. Monitoring and Logging

### Monitoring
Use **Prometheus** and **Grafana** to monitor container metrics (CPU, memory, etc.).

### Logging
Integrate **ELK Stack** or **EFK Stack** to capture and visualize logs from Docker containers.

---

## 5. Automated Testing in Docker

Incorporate automated tests in the CI pipeline:

- **Unit and Integration Testing**: Run unit and integration tests inside Docker containers.
- **Functional Testing**: Use tools like **Selenium** or **Postman** to perform functional testing.

---

## 6. Deployment to Cloud Providers

### AWS ECS
Deploy the Docker image to **AWS ECS** for container orchestration and management.

### Google Cloud GKE or Azure AKS
Demonstrate deployment using managed Kubernetes services like **Google Cloud GKE** or **Azure AKS**.

---

## 7. Blue-Green or Canary Deployments

### Blue-Green Deployment
Deploy a new version alongside the old one and switch traffic between them, ensuring zero downtime.

### Canary Deployment
Gradually roll out the new image to a subset of users, ensuring stability before a full release.

---

## 8. Security and Compliance in the DevOps Pipeline

- Use tools like **Docker Bench for Security** or **Clair** to scan Docker images for vulnerabilities.
- Integrate security checks into your CI/CD pipeline to ensure compliance with security best practices.

---

## 9. Rollback and Failure Recovery

Demonstrate how to quickly roll back to a previous Docker image version in case of a faulty deployment.

### Rollback in Kubernetes
Use Kubernetes’ built-in rollback features:

```bash
kubectl rollout undo deployment/<deployment_name>
## 10. Automated Scaling and Load Balancing

### Kubernetes Auto-scaling
Use a `HorizontalPodAutoscaler` to scale based on CPU or memory usage:

```bash
kubectl autoscale deployment <deployment_name> --cpu-percent=80 --min=2 --max=10
````

Load Balancing
Use Kubernetes Services or Docker Swarm’s overlay network for load balancing across multiple containers.
```vbnet
' Example of a load balancing setup in Docker Swarm
docker service create --name my-service --replicas 3 --publish 80:80 nginx

```
### Key Points:

- **Markdown Tags**: Each section is correctly formatted with headings (`##`, `###`) for clear hierarchy.
- **Code Blocks**: Shell commands and VB.NET examples are placed within proper code blocks for better readability (using `bash` and `vbnet` tags).
- **Bullet Points**: Lists are used for clear step-by-step instructions where necessary.
