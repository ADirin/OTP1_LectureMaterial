## Introduction

In software development, unit testing is a crucial practice aimed at verifying that individual units or components of the code function correctly. These units are typically small and isolated, such as functions or methods. Unit testing ensures that each unit behaves as expected, helping to detect and prevent bugs early in the development process.

## Why Unit Testing?

### 1. Early Detection of Bugs

Unit tests allow developers to catch bugs at an early stage of development. By testing individual units in isolation, developers can identify and fix issues before they escalate into larger problems.

### 2. Facilitates Refactoring

Unit tests provide a safety net when refactoring code. Developers can confidently modify code knowing that if they inadvertently break existing functionality, the unit tests will catch it.

### 3. Improves Code Quality

Writing unit tests encourages developers to write modular and loosely-coupled code. This improves code quality, making it easier to maintain and extend in the future.

### 4. Documentation and Examples

Unit tests serve as documentation for how the code should behave. They also serve as examples for other developers, demonstrating how to use and interact with various components of the codebase.

## Example Application: Calculator

Let's consider a simple example application: a calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).

### Demonstration: Unit Testing in IntelliJ IDEA

### Step 1: Create a New Java Project

1. Open IntelliJ IDEA and select "Create New Project" from the welcome screen.

2. Choose "Java" from the left-hand menu and click "Next."

3. Fill in the project name and location, then click "Finish" to create the project.

### Step 2: Write the Calculator Class

Create a new Java class named `Calculator` with methods for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

```java
public class Calculator {
    public int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    public int subtract(int a, int b) {
        return a - b;
    }

    public int multiply(int a, int b) {
        return a * b;
    }

    public int divide(int a, int b) {
        if (b == 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Cannot divide by zero");
        }
        return a / b;
    }
}

### Step 3: Write Unit Tests
Create a new Java class named CalculatorTest for unit tests.

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;

public class CalculatorTest {

    private final Calculator calculator = new Calculator();

    @Test
    public void testAddition() {
        assertEquals(5, calculator.add(2, 3));
    }

    @Test
    public void testSubtraction() {
        assertEquals(1, calculator.subtract(3, 2));
    }

    @Test
    public void testMultiplication() {
        assertEquals(6, calculator.multiply(2, 3));
    }

    @Test
    public void testDivision() {
        assertEquals(2, calculator.divide(6, 3));
    }

    @Test
    public void testDivisionByZero() {
        assertThrows(IllegalArgumentException.class, () -> calculator.divide(6, 0));
    }
}
````
### Step 4: Run Unit Tests
Right-click on the CalculatorTest class and select "Run 'CalculatorTest'".

IntelliJ IDEA will execute the unit tests and display the results in the "Run" tool window.

Green checkmarks indicate successful tests, while red crosses indicate failures.

# Test-Driven Development (TDD) Process

In Test-Driven Development (TDD), the process is often summarized by the three steps: **Red, Green, Refactor**. Here's what each of these steps involves:

## Red

1. **Write a Test**: Start by writing a unit test for the new functionality you want to add. Since the functionality hasn't been implemented yet, this test will fail.
2. **Run the Test and Fail**: After writing the test, run it to ensure that it fails. This confirms that the test is working correctly and that the functionality isn't accidentally already in place.
3. **Why Red?**: The term "Red" comes from many IDEs and testing tools that show failing tests in red, indicating that the code does not yet meet the desired requirements.

## Green

1. **Implement the Code**: Write the minimal amount of code necessary to make the failing test pass. The goal here is not to write perfect code, but just enough to satisfy the test.
2. **Run the Test and Pass**: After implementing the code, run the test again. If it passes, you’ve confirmed that the implementation works as expected.
3. **Why Green?**: The term "Green" refers to the green color that testing tools often use to indicate that all tests have passed.

## Refactor

1. **Clean Up the Code**: With the test now passing, review and improve the codebase. This might involve removing duplication, simplifying complex logic, improving naming, and adhering to coding standards.
2. **Run the Tests Again**: After refactoring, run all the tests to ensure that your changes haven't broken any functionality. All tests should still pass.
3. **Why Refactor?**: This step ensures that the code is not only functional but also clean, maintainable, and scalable. Refactoring helps in maintaining a high-quality codebase as the software evolves.



# Test-Driven Development (TDD) with Java:  (Example)

## Objective
Understand the principles of Test-Driven Development (TDD) and apply them by incrementally building a `TemperatureConverter` class using JUnit tests in IntelliJ IDEA.

## Introduction to TDD
Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development process in which you write tests for a new feature before implementing the feature itself. The TDD cycle typically involves the following steps:

1. **Write a Test**: Start by writing a test that defines a function or improvements of a function.
2. **Run the Test and Fail**: The test should fail initially because the function is not implemented yet.
3. **Implement the Function**: Write the minimum amount of code required to pass the test.
4. **Run the Test and Pass**: Ensure the test now passes with the implementation.
5. **Refactor**: Clean up the code while ensuring the test still passes.
6. **Repeat**: Continue the cycle for each new functionality.

## Step-by-Step TDD Example: Temperature Conversion

### Step 1: Set Up the Project in IntelliJ IDEA
1. **Create a New Project**:
   - Open IntelliJ IDEA.
   - Go to `File > New > Project`.
   - Choose `Java` as the project type.
   - Name the project `TemperatureConverterTDD` and set the location.
   - Click `Finish`.

### Step 2: Write the First Test
Start by writing a simple test to convert Fahrenheit to Celsius.

1. **Create the Test Class**:
   - Right-click on the `src` directory and select `New > Java Class`.
   - Name the class `TemperatureConverterTest`.
   - Add the following code to the test class:

   ```java
   import org.junit.Test;
   import static org.junit.Assert.*;

   public class TemperatureConverterTest {

       @Test
       public void testFahrenheitToCelsius() {
           TemperatureConverter converter = new TemperatureConverter();
           assertEquals(0, converter.fahrenheitToCelsius(32), 0.01);
       }
   }
### Explanation:

- The test asserts that 32°F is equivalent to 0°C.
2. **Run the Test:**
- Right-click on the TemperatureConverterTest class and select Run 'TemperatureConverterTest'.
- The test will fail since the TemperatureConverter class doesn't exist yet.

### Step 3: Implement the Functionality
Now that the test is failing, implement the simplest solution to pass the test.

1. Create the TemperatureConverter Class:
- Right-click on the src directory and select New > Java Class.
- Name the class TemperatureConverter.
- Implement the fahrenheitToCelsius method:

```java
public class TemperatureConverter {
    public double fahrenheitToCelsius(double fahrenheit) {
        return (fahrenheit - 32) * 5 / 9;
    }
}
````
2. Run the Test Again:

- Run the TemperatureConverterTest class.
- The test should now pass.

### Step 4: Add More Tests
Following TDD, we will now write more tests for other functionalities.

1. Test for Celsius to Fahrenheit:
- Add the following test to the TemperatureConverterTest class:
```java
@Test
public void testCelsiusToFahrenheit() {
    TemperatureConverter converter = new TemperatureConverter();
    assertEquals(32, converter.celsiusToFahrenheit(0), 0.01);
}

```
Explanation:

- This test checks if 0°C is converted to 32°F.
2. Run the Test:
- The test will fail since the celsiusToFahrenheit method is not yet implemented.
3. Implement the Method:
- Add the celsiusToFahrenheit method to the TemperatureConverter class:
```java
public double celsiusToFahrenheit(double celsius) {
    return (celsius * 9 / 5) + 32;
}
```

4. Run the Test Again:

- The test should pass now that the method is implemented.
### Step 5: Add a Test for Edge Cases
1. Test for Extreme Temperatures:
- Add a test method to check for extreme temperatures:
```Java
@Test
public void testIsExtremeTemperature() {
    TemperatureConverter converter = new TemperatureConverter();
    assertTrue(converter.isExtremeTemperature(-50));
    assertFalse(converter.isExtremeTemperature(20));
    assertTrue(converter.isExtremeTemperature(60));
}

```
2. Run the Test:

- The test will fail because the isExtremeTemperature method is not implemented.
3. Implement the Method:
- Add the following method to the TemperatureConverter class:
```java
public boolean isExtremeTemperature(double celsius) {
    return celsius < -40 || celsius > 50;
}
```
4. Run the Test Again:

- All tests should pass, demonstrating the successful implementation of the functionality.
### Step 6: Refactor the Code
1. Review and Clean Up:

- Check if there’s any redundant code or if anything can be optimized.
- Make sure the code is clean and well-organized.
2. Run All Tests:
- After refactoring, run all the tests again to ensure that everything still works as expected.
## Conclusion
This exercise illustrates the power of Test-Driven Development. By writing tests first and implementing only the necessary code to pass those tests, we ensure that our software is reliable, bug-free, and easier to maintain. TDD encourages a disciplined approach to writing code, which helps in building robust and scalable applications.
