## Team & Project Basics

**What is the optimal team size?**

**Can I do the project alone?**  
No. The ICT project requires team work.

**Can we use a technology other than Java?**  
Yes, but you must still comply with all course requirements.

**Can I pass the course without completing the project?**  
No.

**Is participation in the sprint review compulsory?**
Yes. Participation in sprint review meetings is compulsory for all team members, not just the Scrum Master.

## Project Deliverables & Guidance

### [Product Vision](https://github.com/ADirin/OTP1_LectureMaterial/blob/main/Week%201/Home%20Assignment/Product%20Vision.md)
The project vision ensures all team members gain a common understanding of the project's potential. It serves as the initial kick-off for product concept development.

### Project Plan (Non-Technical)
This plan should focus not only on technical aspects but also on team processes, handling obstacles, and risk management. It should include:
*   **Applied Technology**
*   **Risk Assessment**
*   **Team Approach**
*   **Product Requirements**

> **You must create a product backlog in Trello or Jira and share the link with the teacher.**

### High-Level Design
This can include tools like:
*   **Figma** (for UI/UX mockups)
*   **UML** (Unified Modeling Language diagrams)
*   **ER** (Entity-Relationship diagrams for databases)

### Tech Stack Guidance

**What tech stack should we use?**  
Lecture examples are based on Java, so it is the recommended technology. You may use other technologies, but please note that support will be limited to the course's standard stack.

**How complex should the architecture design be?**  
The course expects a functional application, such as a simple Java UI that interacts with a MariaDB database. You are free to implement a more complex architecture, but a stack using **Java, JavaFX, and MariaDB is sufficient** to meet all course requirements.
