# Frequently Asked Questions
**Please Read carefuly prior to send an email**

## Team & Project Basics

**What is the optimal team size?**  
- Four. A smaller team size is also possible, but you must ensure that everybody is involved in the development process.

**Can I do the project alone?**  
No. The ICT project requires team work.

**Can we use a technology other than Java?**  
Yes, but you must still comply with all course requirements.

**Can I pass the course without completing the project?**  
No.

**Is participation in the sprint review compulsory?**
Yes. Participation in sprint review meetings is compulsory for all team members, not just the Scrum Master.


**Which dates for the in-class assignments or quizzes should we trust: Moodle or GitHub?** 
All updates and deadlines listed on Moodle are the correct ones. You must adhere to the Moodle deadlines.

**Can we use document templates provided in other courses (for example, a product definition template) for this course?**
No. All documentation and reports must be based on the templates provided specifically for this course.


## Week 1: 

### Assignments & Quizzes

**What happens if I do not submit the in-class assignments?**  
In-class assignments are compulsory for passing the course and must be submitted by the deadline.

**What is the minimum score to pass the quiz?**  
The passing score is different each week.

**How many times can I attempt the quizzes?**  
Twice.

**What happens if I don't pass all the quizzes?**  
You must take the final exam.

**Can I still take part in OTP2 if I haven't passed OTP1?**  
Yes. However, if you pass OTP2 but not OTP1, you will likely face challenges in passing the course.

### Technology & Team Issues

**Can we use any technology to implement the project?**  
Yes.

**What should I do if a team member does not complete their tasks or does not respond to messages?**  
Contact the teacher.

## Project Deliverables & Guidance

### [Product Vision](https://github.com/ADirin/OTP1_LectureMaterial/blob/main/Week%201/Home%20Assignment/Product%20Vision.md)
The project vision ensures all team members gain a common understanding of the project's potential. It serves as the initial kick-off for product concept development.
**How detailed must the project vision be?**
Please follow the provided template and complete all essential sections as indicated.

**Do you have a more specific example?**
Yes. You may use a project vision document from a previous semester as a reference example (Link will be added ASAP).


### [Project Plan (Non-Technical)](https://github.com/ADirin/OTP1_LectureMaterial/blob/main/Week%201/Home%20Assignment/ProjectPlan..md)
This plan should focus not only on technical aspects but also on team processes, handling obstacles, and risk management. It should include:
*   **Project overview**
*   **Project Objectives**
*   **Scope and Deliverable**
*   **Project Timeline**
*   **Resource Allocation**
*   **Risk Management**
*   **Testing and Quality Assurance**
*   **Documentation and Reporting**

*    **Can we update the project plan?**
  Yes, you can update later if some changes occur during the project implementation

*  **Why have we not created a product definition document?**
  In this course, we apply Agile principles. We create the product backlog directly from the product vision. Later in the course, we will consolidate all our reports. Therefore, a traditional list of requirements is replaced by the process of defining and refining the product backlog. [product documentation see the example](https://github.com/MahnoorFatima02/Luku/blob/main/doc/Software-Project-Documentation.pdf) 


### High-Level Design
This can include tools like:
*   **Figma** (for UI/UX mockups)
*   **UML** (Unified Modeling Language diagrams) *this depends on the Modleing course implemetation*
*   **ER** (Entity-Relationship diagrams for databases) *this depends on the Modleing course implemetation*
  
*   **We don't know UML and ER yet. What should we do?**
  No problem. You will add the software architecture and database design later during OTP2, after you have studied those topics in your courses.


### Tech Stack Guidance

**What tech stack should we use?**  
Lecture examples are based on Java, so it is the recommended technology. You may use other technologies, but please note that support will be limited to the course's standard stack.

**How complex should the architecture design be?**  
The course expects a functional application, such as a simple Java UI that interacts with a MariaDB database. You are free to implement a more complex architecture, but a stack using **Java, JavaFX, and MariaDB is sufficient** to meet all course requirements.

## Week 2: Tools and Setup

**Do we need to install all the tools on our personal computers?**  
Yes.

**I cannot install Docker Desktop on my Mac.**  
Please follow the instructions in the GitHub repository thoroughly. If you still encounter issues, seek help from other resources like ChatGPT.
