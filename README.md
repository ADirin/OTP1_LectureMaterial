**Note:** This is a generic version of the course material. The details of the topics and assignments will be elaborated upon during the **<ins>compulsory *face-to-face* lectures</ins>**. It is important to emphasize that in this course we focus on the process, not merely the project implementation. This means that in each sprint, we apply software engineering principles and methodologies to implement the project.


> In SEP 1 we follow the DevOps approach so remember the follow figure very well.

At the end of each sprint, the lecturers will be available online. All team members must participate and share their implementation with the product owner (teacher).
> **For the project implementation, we follow the agile method as defined in the Agile Manifesto. Therefore, the project implementation is accepted *if and only if* you demonstrate that you followed the agile process as described in the following figure**

# Sprint Review Guidelines for Teams

## Objective
The Sprint Review is an opportunity for teams to demonstrate their progress, gather feedback, and plan for the next sprint. It ensures transparency, assesses the project's trajectory, and maintains alignment with the project's goals.

## What the Teacher Expects from Teams

1. **Completed Work Demonstration:**
   - Demonstrate all completed user stories and tasks.
   - Ensure that the work presented aligns with the sprint goals and acceptance criteria.

2. **Transparency and Honesty:**
   - Clearly state what was accomplished and what was not.
   - Discuss any roadblocks or issues encountered and how they were addressed.

3. **Feedback Collection:**
   - Be open to receiving constructive feedback from peers and the teacher.
   - Engage in discussions to understand different perspectives and suggestions.

4. **Updated Documentation:**
   - Ensure that all relevant documentation, such as user stories, task details, and project artifacts, are up-to-date.
   - Provide clear documentation of any changes made during the sprint.

## How Students Should Prepare Themselves

1. **Update Trello Boards:**
   - Move completed tasks to the "Done" column.
   - Ensure that all task details, comments, and attachments are up-to-date.
   - Tag relevant team members and add any important notes or observations.

2. **Prepare Demonstrations:**
   - Rehearse the demonstration to ensure a smooth presentation.
   - Test all functionalities that will be shown to avoid technical issues during the review.

3. **Review and Reflect:**
   - Conduct an internal team review session to go over what has been completed.
   - Reflect on the sprint process and identify what went well and what could be improved.

4. **Document Roadblocks and Resolutions:**
   - Keep a record of any challenges faced and how they were resolved.
   - Be prepared to discuss these during the review to provide context and learning points.

5. **Gather Feedback Points:**

   - Ensure that these aids are clear, concise, and relevant to the work being presented.

8. **Summarize Key Achievements:**
   - Prepare a brief summary of the key achievements of the sprint.
   - Highlight how these achievements contribute to the overall project goals.

## Specific Points to Address During the Review

1. **Sprint Backlog Overview:**
   - How many use cases were selected in the sprint backlog?
   - How many use cases were implemented?
   - How many use cases are postponed?

2. **Team Effort:**
   - How many hours did each team member spend during the sprint?
   - Provide a breakdown of who did what during the sprint.

3. **AI Tools Utilized:**
   - List any AI tools used during the sprint.
   - Explain how these tools were used to enhance the project.

## During the Sprint Review

1. **Presentation:**
   - Present the completed work clearly and concisely.
   - Use visual aids effectively to enhance understanding.

2. **Engage with Feedback:**
   - Listen actively to feedback from the teacher and peers.
   - Take notes on feedback and suggestions for improvement.

3. **Discuss Next Steps:**
   - Outline the plan for the next sprint based on the feedback received.
