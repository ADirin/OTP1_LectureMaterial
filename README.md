**Note:** This is a generic version of the course material. The details of the topics and assignments will be elaborated upon during the **<ins>compulsory *face-to-face* lectures</ins>**. It is important to emphasize that in this course we focus on the process, not merely the project implementation. This means that in each sprint, we apply software engineering principles and methodologies to implement the project.

At the end of each sprint, the lecturers will be available online. All team members must participate and share their implementation with the product owner (teacher).
> **For the project implementation, we follow the agile method as defined in the Agile Manifesto. Therefore, the project implementation is accepted *if and only if* you demonstrate that you followed the agile process as described in the following figure**
