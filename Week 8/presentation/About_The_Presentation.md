# Instructions for Project Presentation

## Use the Shared Template in Oma:

All teams are required to use the provided presentation template in Oma. This ensures consistency in the format and structure across all presentations.
Make sure your slides are well-organized, clear, and focused on key points.

## Team Member Participation:

- Each team member must *actively participate* in the presentation. Distribute the content equally among all members to ensure everyone contributes.
- Practice beforehand to ensure a smooth flow between speakers and transitions between slides.

## Stick to the Time Limit (**20 Minutes**):

- Each team is strictly limited to 20 minutes for the presentation. Ensure your content is concise and to the point.
- Allocate time for each section (e.g., Introduction, Methodology, Results) and rehearse to stay within the allotted time. Avoid spending too much time on one part of the presentation.

## Content of the Presentation:

Slide 1. Applied AI Tools, GitHub, and Trello Link

## Peer Review Evaluation:

- Your project will be evaluated through a peer review process. This means that in addition to the instructorâ€™s feedback, other teams will assess your presentation.
Ensure your presentation is clear, engaging, and informative, as this will influence your peer review scores.

## Additional Tips:

- Use visuals like graphs, charts, or diagrams to support your explanation.
- Prepare for potential questions from the audience and reviewers.
- Time yourselves during rehearsals to avoid going over the 20-minute limit.
