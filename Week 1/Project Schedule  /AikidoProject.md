- Database includes all belt ranks and their training requirements (e.g., techniques, hours of practice, sparring sessions).

### 2. **Weekly Training Log**
- Users record their weekly training sessions by selecting:

### 4. **Belt Demand Checker**
- After inputting weekly progress, the app displays:
  - Whether the training matches the demands for the next belt.
  - Suggestions for missing elements (e.g., “Practice X technique” or “Complete Y more hours of training”).

### 5. **Instructor Feedback Integration**
- Students can share their training logs with instructors for validation.
- Instructors can leave comments or approve completed requirements.
