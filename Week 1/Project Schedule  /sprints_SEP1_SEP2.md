## Note
- You will not receive support from the course if you use Spring Boot or any non-Java-based framework. However, failing to comply with course requirements, such as the use of Jenkins or Docker, due to a lack of knowledge in applying these technologies is not acceptable and will impact your grade.
- Each team member needs to keep track of the time they spend on each sprint. For example, create an Excel sheet that tracks the time spent on the project.

# Week 1-2 (Sprint 1): Project Planning and Setup
* Define project requirements and specifications.
* Set up version control (e.g., Git) and establish a repository on GitHub.
* Create project structure with separate modules for UI, server-side, and backend.
* Choose a Java framework for each tier (e.g., JavaFX for UI, Spring Boot (see the **Note**), and database).



> *The final lecture of week 2 is an online session. Each team conducts a sprint review meeting, creates a sprint review report, plans the next sprint tasks, designates developers for each task, and finally updates Trello accordingly* 

# Week 3-4 (Sprint 2): Implement UI for Project 1
* Design and implement user interface components using JavaFX or a similar framework.
* Applying unit test in the project
* Using Maven Deppendecy and Refactoring
* Code coverage
* Version contol 

> *The final lecture of week 4 is an online session. Each team conducts a sprint review meeting, creates a sprint review report, plans the next sprint tasks, designates developers for each task, and finally updates Trello accordingly*

# Week 5-6 (Sprint 3): Implement Server-side for Project 1
* Implement business logic and service layers to handle requests from the UI.
* Using Jenkins
> *The final lecture of week 6 is an online session. Each team conducts a sprint review meeting, creates a sprint review report, plans the next sprint tasks, designates developers for each task, and finally updates Trello accordingly*

# Week 7-8 (Sprint 4): Implement Database for Project 1
* Extende the functionality of the application based on the product backlog
* Implement data access layer using JDBC to interact with the database.
* Applying Dockers
* GitHub readme and high level documentation
