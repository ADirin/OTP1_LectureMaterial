# Week 1-2 (Sprint 1-2): Project Planning and Setup
* Define project requirements and specifications.
* Set up version control (e.g., Git) and establish a repository on GitHub.
* Create project structure with separate modules for UI, server-side, and backend.
* Choose a Java framework for each tier (e.g., JavaFX for UI, Spring Boot for server-side, Hibernate for database).
* Set up basic CRUD operations for the database layer.

# Week 3-4 (Sprint 3-4): Implement UI for Project 1
* Design and implement user interface components using JavaFX or a similar framework.
* Connect UI components to the server-side layer using RESTful APIs or other communication protocols.
* Applying unit test in the project
* Using Maven Deppendecy and Refactoring
* Code coverage
* Version contol

# Week 5-6 (Sprint 5-6): Implement Server-side for Project 1
* Set up Spring Boot project for the server-side layer.
* Implement business logic and service layers to handle requests from the UI.
* Integrate server-side with the database layer using Hibernate or another ORM framework.
* Using Jenkins

# Week 7-8 (Sprint 7-8): Implement Database for Project 1
* Design and create database schema using a relational database management system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
* Implement data access layer using Hibernate or JDBC to interact with the database.
* Applying Dockers
* Project presentation

# Week 9-10 (Sprint 9-10): Testing and Debugging for Project 1
* Write unit tests for each layer of the application.
* Perform integration testing to ensure components work together as expected.
* Debug and fix any issues or bugs identified during testing.
* UI localization
* DB Localization

# Week 11-12 (Sprint 11-12): Documentation and Deployment for Project 1
* Write documentation for the project, including user guides and developer documentation.
* Prepare the application for deployment to a production environment.
* Deploy the application to a server or cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Heroku).
* Quality Assurance

# Week 13-14 (Sprint 13-14): Repeat Steps 2-6 for Projects 2-5
* Follow the same process outlined above to create four additional projects, each with its own UI, server-side, and database components.
* Statistically code analysis

# Week 15-16 (Sprint 15-16): Integration and Finalization
* Integrate all five projects into a single system, ensuring they can communicate and share data effectively.
* Perform system testing to validate the integration and functionality of the entire system.
* Finalize documentation and prepare for project presentation or demonstration.
* Documentation
* Final Presentation
