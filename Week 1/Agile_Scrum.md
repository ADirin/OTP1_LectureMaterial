# Introduction to Scrum, Agile, Product Backlog, Product Owner, and Scrum Master

Scrum is an agile framework that facilitates iterative and incremental development of software products.
It emphasizes collaboration, flexibility, and continuous improvement to deliver value to customers efficiently.

Agile methodologies, including Scrum, prioritize adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, and continuous improvement, responding swiftly to changing requirements and market needs.

## Product Backlog:

The product backlog is a prioritized list of requirements, features, enhancements, and fixes that define the scope of work for a software product.
It serves as the single source of truth for what needs to be built, maintained, or improved upon. 
The product backlog evolves over time as new insights are gained, priorities shift, and customer feedback is incorporated. 
It is managed and maintained by the product owner.
