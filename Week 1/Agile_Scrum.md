Introduction to Scrum, Agile, Product Backlog, Product Owner, and Scrum Master

Scrum is an agile framework that facilitates iterative and incremental development of software products.
It emphasizes collaboration, flexibility, and continuous improvement to deliver value to customers efficiently.

Agile methodologies, including Scrum, prioritize adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, and continuous improvement, responding swiftly to changing requirements and market needs.

Product Backlog:

The product backlog is a prioritized list of requirements, features, enhancements, and fixes that define the scope of work for a software product.
It serves as the single source of truth for what needs to be built, maintained, or improved upon. 
The product backlog evolves over time as new insights are gained, priorities shift, and customer feedback is incorporated. 
It is managed and maintained by the product owner.

  - Clicking on the password reset link should take the user to a page where they can enter a new password.

Product Owner:

The product owner is a key role in Scrum responsible for representing the interests of stakeholders and maximizing the value delivered by the development team. 
They are accountable for managing the product backlog, prioritizing items based on business value and customer needs, and ensuring that the team understands the requirements and objectives. 
The product owner collaborates closely with stakeholders to gather feedback, define acceptance criteria, and make informed decisions about the product.

Scrum Master:

The Scrum master is a servant-leader role responsible for facilitating the Scrum process, removing impediments, and enabling the development team to achieve their goals. 
They act as a coach, mentor, and facilitator, guiding the team in adopting Scrum practices and principles, fostering collaboration, and promoting continuous improvement. 
The Scrum master also helps to protect the team from external distractions and ensure that the Scrum framework is adhered to effectively.
