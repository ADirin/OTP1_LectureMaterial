# Create a Team

You have to create a team of four people. With this team, you are going to do a project for the next 16 weeks (8 sprints), with each sprint lasting 2 weeks. 
The first four sprints will focus on the DevOps concept, and in the remaining four sprints, the focus will shift to UI, database localization, quality assurance, and software documentation.

# Sprints Implementation process (**Important Read Carefully**)
In this course, we follow the agile process. In each sprint, the team should plan the forthcoming sprint tasks (Sprint planning). 

## The following figure depicts the process we use in this course for the project _*(worth 50%)*_ :

During spring planning 

1. The team  must update Trello with the sprint backlog,
2. define tasks for each member,
3. and allocate a Scrum Master. 
**The Scrum Master is responsible for task implementation and facilitating the sprint progress. 

> **Every two weeks, there will be a sprint review meeting with the teacher. the meeting is online and orgnize in zoom**
* During this meeting, the team will present their progress,
* Discuss any challenges encountered, and receive feedback. 
* Adjustments to the sprint backlog and report the sprint activities. 
  - This includes detailing the number of tasks implemented,
  - challenges faced,
  - and strategies planned to overcome these challenges in the upcoming sprints.
