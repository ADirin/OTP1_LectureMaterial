# Create a Team

You have to create a team of four people. With this team, you are going to do a project for the next 16 weeks (8 sprints), with each sprint lasting 2 weeks. 
The first four sprints will focus on the DevOps concept, and in the remaining four sprints, the focus will shift to UI, database localization, quality assurance, and software documentation.

# Sprints Implementation process (**Important Read Carefully**)
In this course, we follow the agile process. In each sprint, the team should plan the forthcoming sprint tasks (Sprint planning). 
During spring planning 
1. The team  must update Trello with the sprint backlog,
2. define tasks for each member,
3. and allocate a Scrum Master. 
**The Scrum Master is responsible for task implementation and facilitating the sprint progress. 

> **Every two weeks, there will be a sprint review meeting with the teacher. the meeting is online and orgnize in zoom**
* During this meeting, the team will present their progress,
* Discuss any challenges encountered, and receive feedback. 
* Adjustments to the sprint backlog and report the sprint activities. 
  **This includes detailing the number of tasks implemented,
  **challenges faced,
  **and strategies planned to overcome these challenges in the upcoming sprints.
