  - **Impact**: The potential impact on the project if the risk occurs (high, medium, low).
  - **Mitigation Strategies**: Actions you will take to reduce or manage the risks.

### 4. Hardware and Software Resource Requirements
- List the hardware and software resources required for the project, including:
  - **Hardware**: Any physical devices or infrastructure needed.
  - **Software**: Any development tools, platforms, or libraries required.

### 5. Work Breakdown
- Provide a work breakdown structure (WBS) that outlines the tasks necessary to complete the project, including:
  - **Task Description**: A brief description of each task.
  - **Dependencies**: Any dependencies between tasks.
  - **Team Member Assignment**: Who is responsible for each task.

### 6. Project Schedule
- Develop a project schedule that includes:
  - **Timeline**: Key phases of the project (e.g., requirement gathering, design, development, testing, deployment).
  - **Milestones**: Important deadlines and checkpoints.
  - **Gantt Chart or Timeline**: Visual representation of the schedule (optional but recommended).

### 7. Monitoring and Reporting Mechanisms
- Describe how you will monitor progress and report on the project's status, including:
  - **Progress Tracking**: How you will track the completion of tasks and milestones.
  - **Reporting**: How and when updates will be provided to stakeholders and team members (e.g., weekly reports, meetings).

## Submission Guidelines
- **Format**: The report should be well-structured and submitted as a PDF.
- **Length**: Aim to keep the report concise and to the point.
- **Submission**: Submit your project plan in the designated Dropbox on Oma by **25th August**.

## Evaluation Criteria
Your project plan will be evaluated based on:
- **Clarity and Structure**: How well-organized and clear the report is.
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: The completeness of each section.
- **Feasibility and Realism**: How realistic and achievable the plan is.
- **Risk Awareness**: How well potential risks are identified and managed.
