# Assignment: Setting Up Trello Workspace for Your Project

## Objective
Create a Trello workspace for managing your project, including setting up a product backlog and creating sprints (Sprint 1, Sprint 2, Sprint 3, and Sprint 4).

## Instructions

### Step 1: Create a Trello Account

1. **Sign Up or Log In**:
   - Go to [Trello](https://trello.com/).
   - Sign up for a new account or log in to your existing account.

### Step 2: Create a New Workspace

1. **Create Workspace**:
   - Click on your profile icon in the top right corner.
   - Select **Create Workspace**.
   - Name your workspace (e.g., "Project Management").
   - Add a description (optional).
   - Click **Create**.

### Step 3: Create a New Board for each sprints and product backlog 

1. **Create Board**:
   - In your new workspace, click **Create new board**.
   - Name your board (e.g., "Product backlog Board").
   - Choose a background color or image.
   - Click **Create Board**.

### Step 4: Set Up Columns (Lists in each board)

1. **Add Lists**:
   - On your new board, you will see a column (list) titled **To Do** by default. Click on **Add another list** to create the following lists in each board:
     - Sprint Backlog
     - Done
     - Postpone
     - In progress

### Step 5: Populate the Product Backlog in the backlog board 

1. **Create Cards**:
   - Under the **Product Backlog** list, click on **Add a card**.
   - Enter the title of a task or feature you need for your project.
   - Click **Add card**.
   - Repeat this process to add all the tasks/features for your project.

### Step 6: Plan Sprints

1. **Move Cards to Sprint 1** boards:
   - Drag and drop cards from the **Product Backlog** list to the **Sprint 1** board based on priority and what you plan to achieve in the first sprint.
2. **Move Cards to Subsequent Sprints**:
   - Similarly, move cards to **Sprint 2**, **Sprint 3**, and **Sprint 4** according to your project plan and timelines.

### Step 7: Assign Tasks

1. **Assign Members**:
   - Click on a card within any sprint list.
   - Click on **Members** on the right-hand side of the card.
   - Select team members to assign them to the task.

### Step 8: Set Due Dates

1. **Set Due Dates**:
   - Click on a card.
   - Click on **Due date**.
   - Choose a date and time for the task to be completed.
   - Click **Save**.

### Step 9: Add Task Details

1. **Add Descriptions and Checklists**:
   - Click on a card.
   - Add a detailed description of the task.
   - Click on **Checklist** to add sub-tasks or steps needed to complete the task.
   - Add checklist items and click **Add**.

### Step 10: Track Progress

1. **Move Cards Between Lists**:
   - As tasks are completed during the sprint, move cards from the sprint list to a **Done** list (create this list if it doesn't exist yet).
   - You can also create lists like **In Progress** to visually track the status of tasks.

### Step 11: Collaborate and Communicate

1. **Use Comments**:
   - Click on a card.
   - Use the **Comment** section to communicate with team members, provide updates, or ask questions.

### Step 12: Review and Retrospect

1. **End of Sprint Review**:
   - At the end of each sprint, review the completed tasks in the **Done** list.
   - Move any unfinished tasks to the next sprint or back to the **Product Backlog** if they need to be reprioritized.

## Deliverables

- A Trello workspace named appropriately for your project.
- A Trello boards with the following lists: Product Backlog, Sprint 1, Sprint 2, Sprint 3, and Sprint 4.
- Populated Product Backlog list with tasks/features.
- Sprint 1 through Sprint 4 lists with tasks assigned to each sprint.
- Assigned tasks to team members and set due dates.
- Added descriptions and checklists to tasks.
- Updated task statuses by moving them between lists based on progress.

## Submission

- Share the link to your Trello board with your instructor in [Group setup form](https://metropoliafi-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/amirdi_metropolia_fi/ESuijE86mSREnMeKa-bWqj4BoOa4ZTlMBgG7MarRP4XFWw?e=jycdcw) (Only the scrum master for sprint1 should submit).
- Ensure the board is set to at least 'Workspace visible' so your instructor (amir.dirin@metropolia.fi) can access it.

By following these steps, you will have a structured Trello workspace to manage your project's tasks and sprints effectively.
