# Home Assignment: Software Engineering Project Plan

## Assignment Overview
In this assignment, you are required to develop a short project plan for your software engineering project. This plan should provide a clear and concise overview of how you intend to execute the project. The final project plan must be submitted in the designated Dropbox on Oma by **25th August**.

## Assignment Requirements

### 1. Project Overview
- Provide a brief description of the project you will be working on. This should include:

### 3. Scope and Deliverables
- Clearly define the scope of your project by specifying what will be included and what will be excluded.
- Identify the key deliverables you plan to produce as part of this project. For each deliverable, include a brief description.

### 4. Project Timeline
- Create a project timeline that outlines the key phases and milestones of the project. This timeline should include:
  - Start and end dates for each phase (e.g., requirement gathering, design, development, testing, deployment).
  - Key milestones and deadlines.
  - Any dependencies between tasks.

### 5. Resource Allocation
- Identify the resources required to complete the project. This could include:
  - **Team Members and Roles**: 
  - **Software, Hardware, and Tools**: 
  - **External Resources or Support**: Any external resources or support required.

### 6. Risk Management
- Identify potential risks that could impact the success of your project. For each risk, include:
  - **Description**: A description of the risk.
  - **Likelihood**: The likelihood of the risk occurring (high, medium, low).
  - **Impact**: The impact of the risk on the project (high, medium, low).
  - **Mitigation Strategies**: Mitigation strategies to reduce or manage the risk.

### 7. Testing and Quality Assurance
- Outline your approach to testing and ensuring the quality of your project. This should include:
  - The types of testing you plan to perform (e.g., unit testing, integration testing, user acceptance testing).
  - The criteria for success.
  - Any tools or frameworks you will use for testing.

### 8. Documentation and Reporting
- Specify the documentation you plan to produce throughout the project (e.g., user manuals, technical documentation).
- Describe how you will report on project progress (e.g., weekly updates, meetings, reports).

### 9. Submission
- Once your project plan is complete, submit the document in the designated Dropbox on Oma by **25th August**.

## Submission Guidelines
- The project plan should be a well-structured document, not exceeding 10 pages.
- Use clear and concise language.
- Include any necessary diagrams or charts to support your plan.
- Ensure your document is in PDF format before submission.

## Evaluation Criteria
Your project plan will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
- Clarity and completeness of the project overview and objectives.
- Realism and detail in the scope, timeline, and resource allocation.
- Thoroughness of risk management and testing strategies.
- Quality and structure of the documentation.
- Timeliness of the submission.
