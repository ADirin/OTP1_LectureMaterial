# Java-Based Three-Tier Projects for Students and Teachers

## Project Instructions

Welcome to your Java-based three-tier project! Throughout this course, you will implement a practical project using **Java** and a **relational database** (e.g. **MariaDB**). The goal is to gain hands-on experience in building real-world applications with Java, and you are **required** to use **only Java frameworks** (such as **JavaFX** for the user interface and **JDBC** for database interaction) along with a relational database management system (MariaDB).

## IMPORTANT NOTE 
 - The lectures, demos, assignments, and examples in this course are all based on Java; therefore, using non-Java frameworks in the project is *not* recommended. However, if you choose to use other non-frameworks, please note that you will not receive support from the instructor, and the responsibility for meeting the course and project requirements will rest entirely on your team.
 - The students themselves must add the product backlog user stories and select the implementation of user stories in each sprint, even though recommendations for implementation are provided in this file.

## Project Breakdown for 8 Weeks

Each project should be broken down into phases over the 8 weeks (4 Sprints, each for two weeks) of the course. Below is a suggested timeline:

![Project Completion Journey](/Images/SP1.JPG)

**NOTE:** You must utilize the topics you learn during the lectures in your project, such as JUnit tests, code coverage, CI/CD, containers (Docker), etc....

### Week 1-2: (Sprint 1)
- **Design the database schema** and create necessary tables (e.g., students, teachers, books, etc.).
- **Start the JavaFX user interface** with basic forms (login, registration, etc.).
- *See the schdule for sprint review meeting*

  ![SP](/Images/SP2.JPG)

### Week 3-4: (Sprint 2)
- **Implement CRUD functionality** for core features (adding students, books, assignments, etc.).
- **Link JavaFX interface to MariaDB** for data display and manipulation.
- - *See the schdule for sprint review meeting*

![SP](/Images/SP3.JPG)

### Week 5-6: (Sprint 3)
- **Add additional features** like notifications, reports, and search functionality.
- Improve the **UI/UX design** for a more polished application.
- - *See the schdule for sprint review meeting*

### Week 7: (Sprint 4)
- **Integrate final features** such as progress tracking, reminders, or additional user roles (admin, teacher, student).
- Perform **extensive testing** to ensure all features work as expected.
- - *See the schdule for sprint review meeting*

### Week 8:
- **Prepare final project presentation** and demonstrate the working system.
- **Write project documentation** and explain the system's design and usage.
- - *See the schdule for sprint review meeting*

## Additional Notes:
- **Database**: You will use relational database  such as **MariaDB** for all data storage needs. Design the schema to support user accounts, events, assignments, grades, and any other relevant data.
- **JavaFX**: Use JavaFX for building the user interface. Ensure the application has a clear, user-friendly interface for students and teachers.
- **Relational Database**: Make sure to implement a relational structure (tables with primary and foreign keys) to handle relationships such as student-teacher, course-student, and so on.

[Proposed scheduel](https://amirsilta.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/SCRUM/boards/1/timeline) and sprint implementation (**NOTE**) this is only suggestion and the team must plan more in depth based on the project nature

These projects are practical and directly relevant to everyday life in educational settings. They will help you develop a comprehensive understanding of **Java**, **JavaFX**, and **MariaDB** as you create real-world applications that can be used by students and teachers.
